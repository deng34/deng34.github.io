title: "Has the Health Status of US Citizens Become Better or Worse Since 2014?"
---

This project visualizes a decade of US health statistics (2014-2023) using CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. The interactive visualization presents five key health indicators - general health status, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and arthritis - across all US states.

Inspired by Nathan Yau's [grid map](https://flowingdata.com/2017/12/07/small-multiples-map-grid/) approach (adapted from R to Python), each state is represented as an equal-sized unit to prevent geographical size from distorting data interpretation. The visualization includes features for examining gender differences and temporal changes through an interactive year slider. Color gradients indicate the prevalence rates of each health condition.
