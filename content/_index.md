I received my master's degree in language science (field: psycholinguistics) at [Tohoku University](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/news/university_news/tohoku_university_ranked_number_one_in_japan_for_fourth_consecutive_year.html) and my bachelor's degree in English at Hohai University. During my master's studies, I investigated visual word recognition from a cognitive science perspective in monolinguals and bilinguals. The statistical tools I used include ANOVA, t-tests, Bayes factors, and distributional modeling. You can check [here](https://dengpeng.org/research/) to see my previous research (one paper is still in progress).

I mainly use Python and R for research (setting up experiments, data analysis, etc.) and "casual coding." The other programming languages that I use include MATLAB, Processing, and JavaScript. Additionally, I am familiar with implementing programming skills in cognitive science research tools like eye-tracking, fMRI, and EEG. I have recently developed three individual projects: a Python-based YouTube popularity analysis tool, a machine learning and LLM-based misinformation debunker, and an interactive visualization using D3.js that illustrates US citizen health trends. Welcome to try and have a bit of fun [here](https://dengpeng.org/projects/)!

Currently, I work as a full-time freelance writer in health, technology, and culture. I regularly contribute to influential Chinese media outlets, such as *Sanlian Weeklife*, *Dingxiang Doctor*, and *Netease*. Previously, I worked as a journalist, covering the latest national and international news. If you are interested, you can access some of my articles [here](https://dengpeng.org/articles/).

In my spare time, I enjoy watching and playing tennis, reading, and binge-watching cat videos.
